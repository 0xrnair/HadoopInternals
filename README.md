HadoopDiagrams
==============

This project contains several diagrams describing [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) internals (2.3.0 or later). Even if these diagrams are **NOT** specified in any formal or unambiguous language (e.g., UML), they should be reasonably understandable and useful for any person who want to grasp the main ideas behind Hadoop. Unfortunately, not all the internal details are covered by these diagrams. You are free to help :)

This document is an easy-index of all the diagrams. In the source directory, you can find the diagram's sources in the following formats:
* PNG
* Visio (VDX)

A VDX file can be easily imported with the web-application editor [LucidChart](www.lucidchart.com). Moreover, if requested I can share my files using Google Drive and you can help me in this project.
