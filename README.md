HadoopDiagrams
==============

This project contains several diagrams describing Apache Hadoop internals (2.3.0 or later). Even if these diagrams are **NOT** specified in any formal or unambigous language (e.g., UML), they should be reasonably understandable and useful for any person who want to grasp some internal details of Hadoop.
